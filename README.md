# Weather Display

Weather display made for Hack Club's Neon YSWS. I don't actually have the hardware yet so the demo is on an online editor, but just imagine it's a physical display.

I used a weather API to grab weather data for a location of choice.

This is supposed to work on a 32x64 RGBLED matrix kit using a esp32 microcontroller.

## Extra Scripts

I needed extra scripts to download and convert a bunch of png images to bitmaps. All of the icons can be found under the icon folder and the scripts are in the Github repo (obviously)
